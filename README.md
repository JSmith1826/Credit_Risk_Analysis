# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

In this project we used Python and the Pandas library to prepare a dataset for a number of machine learning processes made possible by the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn python packages. This is an example of supervised machine learning as we had a specific question we were looking to answer. In this case we using machine learning to predict credit risk. The dataset we utilized contained loan information from quarter 1 of 2019.

We ran six different machine learning processes once the data was in proper shape. The machine learning methods we used were:
- Naive Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Cluster Centroid Undersampling
- SMOTEENN Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifying
- Easy Ensemble Classifying
